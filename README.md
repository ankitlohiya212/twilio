There are 2 problems with this tutorial : 
1. The code given in this is a little wrong so twilio.py in this repo is the right one (The one which worked for me)
2. If you run the twilio.py code, you'll recieve an error with a link to follow along [for me it was https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/errors/21606]. Which gives you number of reasons why you could be wrong [ mine was I had not selected the incoming number https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming]


Once all of that is done you can send any message through whatsapp or text messages to yourself from the twilio number you recieve.
